# Fraud Detection
images: EDA graphs

dating.ipynb: EDA, Base model, TD-IDF, LSTM analysis

helpers.py: helper functions

# Motivation and Goal
Having fraud jobs on on one's website/app can result in losing users interest or flagging non-fraud jobs as fraud jobs may upset genuine companies and they might using/ posting their openings on the site. Hence, it is really important to correctly predict fraud and not fraud jobs.

# Methods Used

Data Visualization

Natural Language Processing

Vectorization

Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

Recurrent Neural Netrwork: Long short-term memory (LSTM)

# Data Pipeline

Download dataset from The Employment Scam Aegean Dataset (EMSCAD).

Select and clean relevant features.

Perfom exploratory data analysis.

Build baseline model.

Build up the model pipelines to train the model.

Choose the best performing model to apply to the jobs dataet, and predict if a job listing is a fraud listing or not.


# Data

The dataset consists of 17,880 real-life job ads that aims at providing a clear picture of the Employment Scam problem including title of the job, location of the job, department, salary range, company, description, benefits, employment_type, required experience, required education', industry.
